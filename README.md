Here’s a structured **README.md** draft for your GitHub repository based on the projects you’ve shared—**Sign Language and Action Detection using LSTM** and **Sentiment Analysis using LSTM-BERT**.

You can choose to create two repositories (recommended) or combine both into one. I’ll provide the README structure assuming two **separate repos** for clarity:

---

## 📁 Repo 1: ActionLink — Sign Language and Action Detection using LSTM

```markdown
# ActionLink 🤟 - Sign Language & Action Detection with LSTM

## 🚀 Overview

ActionLink is a deep learning project that uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models to detect and classify sign language gestures and actions in real-time. This project aims to support the hearing-impaired community by enabling gesture recognition using computer vision and sequential data modeling.

## 🎯 Objective

To build a reliable system for recognizing sign language gestures using LSTM-based deep learning models and MediaPipe Holistic tracking.

## 📌 Features

- Real-time sign/action detection using webcam
- Hand and pose keypoint extraction with MediaPipe Holistic
- Sequence-based prediction (30-frame input per gesture)
- Custom dataset support and data collection tool
- Accuracy evaluation with confusion matrix
- Use-case ready for virtual assistants, captioning, remote communication, and more

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- NumPy, Matplotlib

## 🏗️ Architecture

- Keypoint Extraction using MediaPipe
- Sequence Modeling using LSTM
- Real-time Prediction via OpenCV
- Model Evaluation and Training Pipeline

## 📁 Repo 2: ReviewLens — Sentiment and Helpfulness Detection Using LSTM-BERT

```markdown
# ReviewLens 📝 - Sentiment & Helpfulness Detection with LSTM + BERT

## 🌐 Overview

ReviewLens is a hybrid sentiment analysis system combining LSTM and BERT to classify product reviews as positive, negative, or neutral, while also predicting their helpfulness. Built as a web app using Flask, this tool supports smarter review filtering and decision-making for e-commerce.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

With the overwhelming number of product reviews online, it's hard to identify which ones are genuinely helpful. Traditional sentiment classifiers often miss nuances like sarcasm or implicit sentiment.

## ✅ Solution

This project integrates:
- **LSTM** for sequential analysis of long reviews
- **BERT** for capturing deep contextual relationships
- **Flask Web App** for real-time user interaction
- **Amazon Fine Food Reviews** dataset for training

## 💡 Features

- Accurate sentiment classification (positive/negative/neutral)
- Helpfulness scoring based on class probability
- Web-based interface for live predictions
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / HuggingFace Transformers
- Flask
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- HTML/CSS for frontend

## 🖥️ Running Locally

```bash

python app/app.py
```

## 🧪 Evaluation

| Model        | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|--------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| LSTM         | 84.5%    | 85.2%     | 83.8%  | 84.5%    |
| BERT         | 90.1%    | 91.0%     | 89.5%  | 90.2%    |
| LSTM + BERT  | **93.4%**| **94.0%** | **92.3%**| **93.1%** |

Would you like me to generate the actual `README.md` files for you, or do you want to combine both projects into a single GitHub repository README instead?
